# pltorch - perl Torch, inspired by PyTorch

PyTorch is the standard for AI development, yet the techniques for creating weights and handling tensor operations in its Python package aren't unique to Python—they're just most popularly implemented there. By considering the density of Python's dynamic data structures, which often incur higher memory overhead due to object references and garbage collection, this Perl-based Torch.pm draft leverages PDL (Perl Data Language) for compact, contiguous memory storage of numerical arrays. PDL uses efficient C-backed ndarrays with minimal overhead, enabling denser packing than Python lists or NumPy arrays in many cases. Lessons from PyTorch feedback, such as gradient checkpointing (recomputing intermediates to save memory), mixed precision (using lower-bit types like PDL's 'float' or 'short' for 16-bit equivalents), and avoiding unnecessary copies via inplace operations, inform optimizations here. For speed, critical ops suggest XS integration for C-level performance, reducing Perl interpreter overhead—drawing from PyTorch's C++ backend. This makes the Perl version potentially more memory-efficient for AI research, especially on resource-constrained setups, while supporting quantization (e.g., to 8-bit 'byte' types) as seen in DeepSeek-OCR community optimizations.
